### Introduction

This section aims to provide you with all you need to know about React, to feel the power of a Frontend Framework and also to help you create highly scalable React applications as well as beautiful websites. But before we jump right into it, we need to answer one question.

### Why React?

As you already know from the previous section, React is one of the most powerful, widely used frontend frameworks. If you have done the previous lesson and are here because you decided React is the framework to go for, you can skip this "Why React?" part of this lesson. However, if you just stumbled over this, or if you are still unsure about whether to learn React or not, let me convince you.

The landscape for frontend frameworks has been changing a lot over the last few years, so it is understandable to be "scared" of going for the "wrong" one.
[This](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/11/brutal-lifecycle-javascript-frameworks/) article shows the recent development of frontend frameworks quite well.

However, once you start diving deeper into a framework, you will begin to love it, we promise. It makes your code easily scalable, more readable, and probably a thousand times more efficient (just our modest estimation).

Just to name a few reasons on why to learn React.js:

- Reusability of components
- Well supported, due to its popularity
- React is unopinionated, which means that it won't force you to follow any specific patterns or logic, it's all up to you.
- Smaller learning curve, especially when you already have a good grasp of JavaScript and HTML from our previous lessons.

If you need more convincing, the [2020 StackOverflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-web-frameworks-all-respondents2) should be reason enough to get excited about learning React. Still unsure? Check out [this](https://medium.com/@SilentHackz/top-10-reasons-why-you-should-learn-react-right-now-f7b0add7ec0d) article.

_Convinced and excited? Great, because it's going to change your life! Let's dive right into it._

### Components

Applications built with React are made with (reusable) components. Components are your "building blocks" in React. To gain confidence using React, you should learn to divide your application or project into separate components. The following picture gives you an idea of how to do that with a very basic app.

![Simple Homepage](https://i.imgur.com/kNZibRn.png)

For example this simple website could be divided into the following sections (components):

- `App`, which represents your main application and which will be the parent of all the other components.
- `Navbar`, which will be the Navigation bar
- `MainArticle`, which will be the component that renders your content.
- `NewsletterForm`, which is a simple form that let's a user input his email to receive the weekly newsletter

In React, each component is an ES6 module, which is per se independent. But through the ES6 introduced `import` statement,  you can import components into other components like so:
`import ExampleComponent from "./components/ExampleComponent`. This allows us to write each component as its own module in a separate file and later import all modules to the file that contains them. (In our case that would be App.js)

In the beginning, it might be a little bit difficult to figure out the best component structure, especially when state and props come into play. This topic will be discussed in the following sections.  For now, don't worry too much about the component structure, understanding of best practices comes with experience. React components, in general, can and usually do have parent or child components. This system of structuring your applications helps to keep your code structured and makes it easy to keep track of your components' relationships with each other.

To give you an example of a basic component, see the following code:

~~~javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class App extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super()
    }

    {/* Javascript functions can we written here */}

    render() {
        return (
            <div className="App">
            Hello World!
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default App
~~~

Don't get overwhelmed. It isn't as difficult as it might look at the beginning. Let's walk through it step by step.

~~~javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
~~~

With the above `import` statement, we are importing React and the Components module from the React library, which allows us to create a class component. If you are wondering why we have to wrap `Component` into curly brackets and `React` not, this is due to the way they are exported from the `react` module. Default exports are imported without curly brackets; everything else must be wrapped in curly brackets. Don't worry about this too much as we will get plenty of exposure to import and export statements soon.

~~~javascript
class App extends Component {
    {/* Some logic we haven't yet talked about. */}
}
~~~

Secondly, we are declaring the class component, which is just a JavaScript class that extends the Component class we imported earlier. One thing to notice is that React components should always be declared with a capital letter at the beginning. This is a naming convention used by most developers and recommended by the React core team at Facebook.

~~~javascript
constructor() {
    super()
}
~~~

Next is the constructor. A constructor is not obligatory in a class component, but you will most likely encounter one because it becomes important when concepts like inheritance and state are involved. To get used to seeing it, it has been included here. You will usually see developers passing `props` as an argument to the constructor and also to the `super()` call, which must be called in any constructor. However, you will not learn about props here. This concept will be discussed further in the next lesson. The idea here is to expose you to the terminology that we will be using in the future.

~~~javascript
{/* Some logic we haven't yet talked about. */}
~~~

This syntax may look weird at first, but it is nothing more than a simple comment. In React, you write comments within curly brackets and quotes.

~~~javascript
render() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
        Hello World!
        </div>
    )
}
~~~

The most unfamiliar code is likely the render function, which returns something that looks like HTML, but is actually JSX. One of the primary characteristics and features of React is the ability to combine JavaScript and JSX. **JSX** is an HTML-like syntax that will be transpiled into JavaScript so a browser will be able to process it. One thing you should know about JSX is that you can't use the HTML protected words, such as `class` or `onchange`. Instead of `class` you write `className` and instead of `onchange` you write `onChange`. In general, all attributes in JSX are written in camelCase. You should be fairly familiar with that naming convention from the naming of variables in JavaScript. The render function you see is the most used React lifecycle function (more to that in another section). The only thing you should know for now is that every React class component needs a render function, which returns _one_ JSX element. So whatever you want to return needs to be wrapped in a single element.

Finally, to be able to reuse this `App`component we created in other files of our project, we have to export the component. In our example, we export the component as the file's default export:

~~~javascript
export default App;
~~~

If you have multiple components in one file, you could export each component separately by adding the `export` keyword before the declaration of the component. However, if you export a component as a default, you can import it without wrapping curly brackets around it. If you export multiple components, you have to import them inside of curly brackets.

So far, so good! We have already learned a lot about components in React, and let me tell you, class components are just one way of defining components. In React, another way is to use functional components.

A basic functional component looks like the following

~~~javascript
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  return <div className="App">Hello World!</div>;
};

export default App;
~~~

As you can see, there are a couple of differences between functional and class based components.

1. We don't have to import and extend "Component" from React;
2. We don't need a constructor.
3. We don't need the render function, but instead a return statement

There are more differences, which we will encounter when discussing props and state.

For further understanding of React components, [this short article](https://dev.to/sarah_chima/an-introduction-to-react-components-cke) provides a great overview.

For further understanding of the difference between functional and class based components, read [this article](https://medium.com/@Zwenza/functional-vs-class-components-in-react-231e3fbd7108). They discuss concepts like state and lifecycle methods, which we haven't talked about yet. However, keep them in mind because it will prove useful later on in the course.

### Create-react-app

Developers at Facebook came up with a great tool called create-react-app, which sets up a complete React app for you. By running one command, it does all the necessary setup and configuration for you to immediately start working on your project.

If you want to see all the things we have discussed in action, go ahead and run `npx create-react-app my-first-react-app` in your terminal, `cd` into the project by typing `cd my-first-react-app`, and then open it in your text editor of choice. If you want, you can view the project in the browser via the command `npm start`.

### Index.js and App.js

Two of the most important files create-react-app includes for you are index.js and App.js. `index.js` is the entry point of your application by default. Open up you index.js file and check out this line:
``ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))`
In short, what this line of code does is that it tells react to render the App component into the DOM, exactly into the element with the id "root". Every create-react-app project has a root div, which is visible in the index.html file in your public directory. That means, should you decide to name your main application component different than App.js, make sure to change the index.js as well.

If you want to get a better understanding of how create-react-app works and which files it creates for you, make sure to check out [this article](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-with-create-react-app-d93147444a27/) and watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUdtgnwrA14) to really understand the file system create-react-app sets up for you.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
1. Read the first couple of pages of the react.js documentation. In general their documentation is a great resource for coming back to at a later point, if you have to get more familiar with certain concepts, or have to fresh up something. So let's get started. Read [this](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html), [this](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html), [this](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html) and [this](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) article. In the last one they already introduce the concept of props. We haven't looked at that yet, so don't worry too much about it, but it can't hurt having a look at it.
2. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPT3bFIwJYA&list=PL55RiY5tL51oyA8euSROLjMFZbXaV7skS) video to get another quick explanation of react. And then watch those ([one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G40iHC-h0c0&list=PL55RiY5tL51oyA8euSROLjMFZbXaV7skS&index=4), [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wK4gHoOh1g&list=PL55RiY5tL51oyA8euSROLjMFZbXaV7skS&index=5)) videos from the same series, which focus on components. Feel free to code along with the whole course if you enjoy it.
